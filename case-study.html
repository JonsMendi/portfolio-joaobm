              <p class="case-study_text">MyMovies was my first web app developed using the MERN Stack. The
                objective was to give users access to details regarding 
                movies. As well, users are allowed to create and update their profiles
                with the option to add movies to a favorite list.

                from scratch using JavaScript as the main language. Additionally, having the challenge 
                to develop my knowledge using for the first time imperial frameworks such as 'React.js' and 'Express.js'.

              <h3>Approach</h3>
              <h5>Server-Side</h5>
              <p class="case-study_text">The project started with the design of the Back-End facility where the objective was to create a RESTful API 
                using Node.js and Express.js as a framework, interacting with MongoDB, a NoSQL database.
                Using CRUD methods, the idea was to create HTTP interactions like GET, POST, PUT, CREATE, and DELETE 
                all tested via Postman. Additionally was required to understand and provide security methods for the 
                interaction with the database using JWT authentication.
                </p>
                <h5>Client-Side</h5>
              <p class="case-study_text">Jumping to the Front-end, the goal was to create a single-page responsive application using React as a framework that can interact with the already built API through request.
                The web application contains different components views starting with the Registration followed by the Login that gives access to the Main view where a list of all movies is displayed. 
                Through this Main view, the user is allowed to access individually each movie's details, access their Profile view, and Logout.
                Accessing an individual movie detail will be displayed detailed information and the possibility to add the specific movie to the favorite list.
                On the Profile view, the user can update the profile, check the favorite list and delete the account.

              <h3>Challenges</h3>
              <p class="case-study_text">
                To date, myMovies was the most challenging project that I ever made. 
                Understanding the concepts of Server-Side communications at the beginning was very abstract. 
                Identifying and tracking the errors was quite hard at the beginning for me, but at the same 
                time was when I started to understand better how important is to subdivide big problems into 
                small problems, using our good friend ‘console.log’ to track each step of each method and finally 
                responded with a big solution.
                The Front-End was as well, very challenging. Studying and understanding how React is structured, 
                and how communicates between components was a bigger process than I was imagining. It took me a 
                while to understand how to cross and update information through ‘props’, ’state’ and the logic 
                of 'Lifecycle Components'. But like always, with lot of time, practice and information absorbed 
                through documentations I started to get closer to the problems and feeling more confortable with all the React concepts.
